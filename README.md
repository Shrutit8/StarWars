# Starwars

The following code has been created to fetch the list of StarWars characters from an API and to display character detail for each character on clicking the corresponding link of the character.

## Installation

Use the Starwars.zip file to install StarWars application.

-> Clone/Download the [Repo File](https://github.com/Shrutit8/StarWars).

-> Run the following command

```bash

yarn install
yarn run dev

```

## Link

Code will run at local host. At my end this was the  [Link]( http://localhost:8081). It can be different for your machine.


## Time Taken

Approximately 8 hours were taken to finish the assignment. My main focus was on the link navigation and routing aspect. Styling has been minimalist. 

Let me know if you require any clarification or face any error while installing.
